This Restaurant Picker application is built using Ruby on Rails 5.1.4 and allows users to submit a location in order to receive a random restaurant. Users can then save that restaurant and its information into the database or search for a new random restaurant.

Users also have the ability to access a list of saved restaurants and then log a review of the restaurant into the database for future use.
